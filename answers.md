1.  If you only had 200 labeled replies, how would you improve the model without collecting thousands more?
--> I'll use data augmentation to generate additional training examples using a small dataset by rewording and switching words in the responses that already exist.  Then, using a strong pre-trained model like Roberta—which learns considerably more quickly from sparse data—I would apply transfer learning.

2.  How would you ensure your reply classifier doesn’t produce biased or unsafe outputs in production?
--> To identify any weaknesses, I will first audit the training data to eliminate bias before stress-testing the model with challenging inputs.  In order to stress-test the system, I also use adversarial testing to develop difficult test cases that include edge cases, unclear content, and possible failure modes.

3.  Suppose you want to generate personalized cold email openers using an LLM. What prompt design strategies would you use to keep outputs relevant and non-generic?
--> My approach is to use precise context, unambiguous examples, and strict guidelines in the prompt to create unique and customized email openers. I would give the LLM specific instructions on tone and length to direct the output, feed it important information about the prospect, and provide it with a few examples of effective openers.
